# neofetch-win #

Simple, ultra-lightweight neofetch clone for Windows 10+ written in C++ and installable through winget. The executable is just under 75KB and requires no dependencies other than the MS Visual C++ redists (which should be installed already, and if they're not my installer will take care of that for you :)

Note: source code relies on C++20 features, if you wish to build it from source, use C++20 or later, otherwise it will NOT compile
## Install ##

`winget install neofetch`

`neofetch`

That's it
